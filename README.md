# CoalFireEstimation
The software Coal Fire Estimation (Mine Fire) is based on the underground mine fire, This software is being developed with the intention to provide a detection of this underground mine fire. To Detect the mine fire before it occurs by checking the composition of gas in the mines. I have tried to make this project which predicts about the fire in coal mines. So, we can prevent such a hazard to happen. To ensure the safety of the coal mine workers this project will help them by alarming before hand so that before the fire bursts out they can take preventive measures which will also save the lives of the workers thus ensuring more safety and security.

Mine Fire is a serious problem for the coal mining industry and will continue to mine safety endangering human lives, losing valuable natural resources, making mining
difficult or impossible and polluting environment from the evolution of toxic gasses and fumes. 

The development of virtual mine fire detection, prevention, control and combining technology will give a quantum jump for the Indian mining industry to survive in this liberalized and competitive global economy. In the last few years, the application of information technology has achieved considerable success in many parts of the mining industry. It also is used in the various aspects of the mine fire. Some research workers have already applied information technology for mine fire detection, prevention and control.

This paper reviews the status of application of information technology at present and future needs of information technology in mine fire detection, prevention and control.
Infrastructure needs and procedure to develop an information management system are described.

Previously, for the purpose of detection of “Mine Fire” manual system was used. Computerization of the above systein make it economical, technical and efficient. The
above feasibility has to be decided with due care. The reason thereof is the inherent factor of project risk.

I have created Coal Fire Estimation while doing my internship at CSIR - CIMFR Dhanbad. This project is solely created by me in 2 months with the help of Shri Ajay Khalkho (Principal Scientist, CIMFR, Dhanbad) and I express my deep senses of gratitude to him under whose guidance the present project work has been carried out successfully am highly indebted to him for his valuable and sincere guidance and constant encouragement during the development of this project work. I again thank him for providing his precious time to me in the completion of my project. I shall remain ever grateful to him, who unselfishly inculcated in me the spirit of hard work and help me in each and every aspect of this project. He had always provided me a new tricks and techniques to me for solving my project's problems.

Thank You
